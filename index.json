Description: Reverse engineering is getting easier thanks to IDA/Ghidra decompiler! We are given a binary file named chall.

However, when I tried to decrypt the ciphertext using the key given, I failed to get the flag. At this point I read the description again and saw that it said something about IDA/Ghidra, and my thought was that IDA and Ghidra might give false results.

Description: Deja vu in Windows. For this challenge, we are given a binary and 2 library files. A quick look into the binary reveals that it is using dynamic linking in the implementation of the program. How the binary works? To briefly explain, ResolveModuleFunction() is used with a hash value to retrieve functions from a library file (which we call dynamic linking). So first thing we should do is to retrieve all the functions called. That should be fairly easy with some debuggings, since dlsym() function directly returns function name from the library. How to get function names? Set a breakpoint at dlsym() call and read parameter name. After a while, I saw that our flag is splitted into chunks of 4 bytes, and the scheme of the checker should look like this: encoded = pow(chunks[i], e, m) with e and m are the values we get from rand() calls. I’ve been doing both Crypto and Reversing, so I quickly realized that this is just doing RSA encryption. So I wrote a script, with some debuggings to retrieve rand() values runtime, and I got the flag. from Crypto.Util.number import * from factordb.factordb import FactorDB x = [0xf0d3, 0x085f, 0x8e63, 0x8249, 0xc6a1, 0x0c6d, 0xaef5, 0xd5df, 0xe68d, 0xf3fb] y = [0x00002350f23a0dff, 0x000032d18e9d4d33, 0x000003866cd71f1b, 0x000010ae9be3fc8f, 0x000009d942eff67d, 0x00001de2e3aa8bb1, 0x0000103fc65841f3, 0x0000011a0970edc9, 0x00005f8d20bddf39, 0x000045b14e11e0ed] enc = [0xFE4C025C5F4, 0x1B792FF17E8A, 0x183B156AB40, 0xBEFFCF5E5DA, 0x297CF86E251, 0xEB3EDC1D4B4, 0xFA10CE3A08, 0x2BDD418672, 0x5EBB5050EA46, 0x5BF9B73CF86] flag = b\"\" for i in range(len(x)): f = FactorDB(y[i]) f.connect() ls = f.get_factor_list() phi = 1 for j in ls: phi *= (j - 1) d = inverse(x[i], phi) dec = pow(enc[i], d, y[i]).to_bytes(4, \"little\") flag += dec print(flag.decode()) Flag is: zer0pts{L00k_th3_1nt3rn4l_0f_l1br4r13s!} ","date":"2023-07-16","objectID":"/zer0ptsctf2023-rev/:3:0","tags":["RE","zer0ptsCTF","english"],"title":"zer0ptsCTF 2023 - Reverse Engineering Writeups","uri":"/zer0ptsctf2023-rev/"},{"categories":["Writeups"],"content":"topology Challenge Information Given file: Get it here! Description: No worries. It’s a network topology, not an algebraic one. For this challenge, we are provided with a binary file, topology. I did some analysis on it, and noted out some comments about how the challenge works. My note Input is splitted into 10 chunks, each has 8 bytes. The parent process spawns many child process, each has a different whoami value. Each child process is linked with a function, which is derived from f[whoami - 1] (in handle_message). Each function has 10 cases, each case has a unique solution to make result = 0 (so that OK is sent from the child process back to the parent process). Suppose that the first time a function is called, case 0 is used to check the input, and next time case 1 is used, and so on. Move on to the main check function in network_main, and here is where things get more obvious. How the checker works? The first chunk of the input is checked using case 0 of all the functions (that is linked with all child processes). Similarly, the second chunk of the input is checked using case 1 of all the functions (since all of them are already called once), and thing goes the same for all remaining chunks of the input. A chunk is considered correct if at least 5 functions accept it. So our problem is how to solve the cases. At first I was thinking of using angr, but I failed to do so, and I ended up using z3 to solve them. Below is the example of solving a case which leads to the first chunk of our flag: from z3 import * from Crypto.Util.number import * s = Solver() x = BitVec(\"x\", 64) def _byteswap_uint64(x): chunks = [Extract((i + 1) * 8 - 1, i * 8, x) for i in range(8)] reversed_chunks = chunks return Concat(reversed_chunks) def __ROL8__(x, a): return RotateLeft(x, a) def __ROR8__(x, a): return RotateRight(x, a) s.add( __ROL8__( _byteswap_uint64( [...] ), 12, ) == 0x6AA189484E6B1D4 ) if s.check() == sat: result = s.model() print(long_to_bytes(result[x].as_long()).decode()[::-1]) # zer0pts{ To know which chunk is correct, we can set a breakpoint at base + 0xE5C6F and read ebp register to know the amount of functions that accept it.

Although it looks complicated at first, but turns out the algorithm is easy to understand. About the intended algorithm flow The algorithm here is very simple, it takes our input as a string, splits it into several “words”, then it checks whether: Our input has only two words. First word (after converted to int) should satisfy this equation: (x + 5) * 9 - 1 == 971. Second word should be bananas. It is very easy to solve the challenge from this point, and our input should be 103 bananas according to the above rules.

Conclusions The string given in the PDF file doesn’t contain any of these: [].*. Therefore, we can skip the correspondence parts in the source. For the substring between (...): The program sets the value of qword_4040[i] (with i being the character following the closing bracket) to that substring. For example: If we have (ab)c, the program will set qword_4040[c] = \"ab\". For the space: Don’t mind about it, kinda useless. For the apostrophe: Filter out qword_4040[i] (with i being the character following that apostrophe). Suppose we have something like (ab)c'c, then the program will filter out a and b. For the substring between ?...?: The program uses applied filter (as of the above clarification) to omit out some characters, and take the last character remaining. With that being considered, I wrote everything on a piece of paper (no script sadly) to get the flag from the hint provided in the PDF file (also with some reasonable guesses, too). Flag is: actf{both_irregular_and_inexpressive} Appendix After having solved the challenge, I did try to write a Python script. However, I failed to generate the flag using Python, maybe because the program has some additional constraints that I did not read carefully back then. But who cares, I got the flag anyway.

My thanks are due in three quarters. To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with few pretensions. To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an obscure aspirant. To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended Author. The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them, _i.e._, to my Publishers and the select Reviewers, I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart. actf{3verything_is_just_linear_algebr4_33e431e52e896c92} Flag is: actf{3verything_is_just_linear_algebr4_33e431e52e896c92} Appendix I tried using z3 to solve the input as a BitVec, but gained no success.

Load the binary, we notice the function func_flag. Let’s check that out! fgets(s, 256, stdin); for ( i = 0; i \u003c= 0x4C; ++i ) s[i] ^= m1[i]; if ( memcmp(s, \u0026t, 0x4DuLL) ) return 0xFFFFFFFFLL; for ( j = 0; j \u003c= 0x4C; ++j ) s[j] ^= m2[j]; printf(\"Flag: %s\\n\", s); return 0LL; This is the main part of the function. Our input string s will be used to XOR with two lists, m1 and m2. We can use export data in IDA to dump out the contents of m1 and m2, as shown below (do the same for m2). We also know that after the first XOR, s needs to be equal to t (which we can get from the memory, too). Then we can reverse XOR to find s, and the algorithm looks like this. t[i] ^ m1[i] = s[i % 8] Since after the check, we continue to XOR m2 with the modified s (which should be equal to t after the memcmp), we get the algorithm to print out our flag. t[i] ^ m2[i] = flag[i] We can use this Python script to get the flag. m2 = [ 0x64, 0x1E, 0xF5, 0xE2, 0xC0, 0x97, 0x44, 0x1B, 0xF8, 0x5F, 0xF9, 0xBE, 0x18, 0x5D, 0x48, 0x8E, 0x91, 0xE4, 0xF6, 0xF1, 0x5C, 0x8D, 0x26, 0x9E, 0x2B, 0xA1, 0x02, 0xF7, 0xC6, 0xF7, 0xE4, 0xB3, 0x98, 0xFE, 0x57, 0xED, 0x4A, 0x4B, 0xD1, 0xF6, 0xA1, 0xEB, 0x09, 0xC6, 0x99, 0xF2, 0x58, 0xFA, 0xCB, 0x6F, 0x6F, 0x5E, 0x1F, 0xBE, 0x2B, 0x13, 0x8E, 0xA5, 0xA9, 0x99, 0x93, 0xAB, 0x8F, 0x70, 0x1C, 0xC0, 0xC4, 0x3E, 0xA6, 0xFE, 0x93, 0x35, 0x90, 0xC3, 0xC9, 0x10, 0xE9] t = [0x2C,0x4A,0x0B7,0x99,0x0A3,0x0E5,0x70,0x78,0x93,0x6E,0x97,0x0D9,0x47,0x6D,0x38,0x0BD,0x0FF,0x0BB,0x85,0x99,0x6F,0xE1,0x4A,0x0AB,0x74,0x0C3,0x7B,0x0A8,0x0B2,0x9F,0x0D7,0x0EC,0x0EB,0x0CD,0x63,0x0B2,0x39,0x23,0x0E1,0x84,0x92,0x96,0x09,0x0C6,0x99,0x0F2,0x58,0x0FA,0x0CB,0x6F,0x6F,0x5E,0x1F,0x0BE,0x2B,0x13,0x8E,0x0A5,0x0A9,0x99,0x93,0x0AB,0x8F,0x70,0x1C,0x0C0,0x0C4,0x3E,0x0A6,0x0FE,0x93,0x35,0x90,0x0C3,0x0C9,0x10,0x0E9] for i in range(len(t)): print(end=chr(t[i] ^ m2[i])) Flag is: HTB{cr4ck1ng_0p3n_sh3ll5_by_th3_s34_sh0r3} ","date":"2023-03-24","objectID":"/htb2023/:4:0","tags":["RE","pwn","web","crypto","forensics","misc","htb","english"],"title":"Cyber Apocalypse 2023: The Cursed Mission - Writeups","uri":"/htb2023/"},{"categories":["Writeups"],"content":"Hunting License Challenge Information Given file: Get it here!

Note: This challenge had a docker but it might be closed at the time you are reading this. All needed files will be given in the write-ups. Category: Binary Exploitation/Pwnable Difficulty: Very Easy We are given a binary, a C file and a netcat server to answer some questions. From the netcat, we are given some informations about the binary that we will going to work with. When compiling C/C++ source code in Linux, an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file is created. The flags added when compiling can affect the binary in various ways, like the protections. Another thing affected can be the architecture and the way it's linked. If the system in which the challenge is compiled is x86_64 and no flag is specified, the ELF would be x86-64 / 64-bit. If it's compiled with a flag to indicate the system, it can be x86 / 32-bit binary. To reduce its size and make debugging more difficult, the binary can be stripped or not stripped. Dynamic linking: A pointer to the linked file is included in the executable, and the file contents are not included at link time. These files are used when the program is run. Static linking: The code for all the routines called by your program becomes part of the executable file. Stripped: The binary does not contain debugging information. Not Stripped: The binary contains debugging information. The most common protections in a binary are: Canary: A random value that is generated, put on the stack, and checked before that function is left again. If the canary value is not correct-has been changed or overwritten, the application will immediately stop. NX: Stands for non-executable segments, meaning we cannot write and execute code on the stack. PIE: Stands for Position Independent Executable, which randomizes the base address of the binary as it tells the loader which virtual address it should use. RelRO: Stands for Relocation Read-Only. The headers of the binary are marked as read-only. Run the 'file' command in the terminal and 'checksec' inside the debugger. The output of 'file' command: ✗ file test test: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=5a83587fbda6ad7b1aeee2d59f027a882bf2a429, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped. The output of 'checksec' command: gef➤ checksec Canary : ✘ NX : ✓ PIE : ✘ Fortify : ✘ RelRO : Partial We are able to answer some first questions using these informations. After answering these questions correctly, we are provided with more informations about the binary. Great job so far! Now it's time to see some C code and a binary file. In the pwn_questionnaire.zip there are two files: 1. test.c 2. test The 'test.c' is the source code and 'test' is the output binary. Let's start by analyzing the code. First of all, let's focus on the '#include \u003cstdio.h\u003e' line. It includes the 'stdio.h' header file to use some of the standard functions like 'printf()'. The same principle applies for the '#include \u003cstdlib.h\u003e' line, for other functions like 'system()'. Now, let's take a closer look at: void main(){ vuln(); } By default, a binary file starts executing from the 'main()' function. In this case, 'main()' only calls another function, 'vuln()'. The function 'vuln()' has 3 lines. void vuln(){ char buffer[0x20] = {0}; fprintf(stdout, \"\\nEnter payload here: \"); fgets(buffer, 0x100, stdin); } The first line declares a 0x20-byte buffer of characters and fills it with zeros. The second line calls 'fprintf()' to print a message to stdout. Finally, the third line calls 'fgets()' to read 0x100 bytes from stdin and store them to the aformentioned buffer. Then, there is a custom 'gg()' function which calls the standard 'system()' function to print the flag. This function is never called by default. void gg(){ system(\"","date":"2023-03-24","objectID":"/htb2023/:13:0","tags":["RE","pwn","web","crypto","forensics","misc","htb","english"],"title":"Cyber Apocalypse 2023: The Cursed Mission - Writeups","uri":"/htb2023/"},{"categories":["Writeups"],"content":"Getting Started Challenge Information Given file: Get it here!

Description: You ’re still trying to collect information for your research on the alien relic. Scientists contained the memories of ancient egyptian mummies into small chips, where they could store and replay them at will. Many of these mummies were part of the battle against the aliens and you suspect their memories may reveal hints to the location of the relic and the underground vessels. You managed to get your hands on one of these chips but after you connected to it, any attempt to access its internal data proved futile. The software containing all these memories seems to be running on a restricted environment which limits your access. Can you find a way to escape the restricted environment ? Note: This challenge had a docker but it might be closed at the time you are reading this. All needed files will be given in the write-ups. Category: Miscellaneous Difficulty: Easy We are provided with a server and it’s source. From the source, we know that it is a SSH server. One thing particular about this server is that, if the username is restricted, we will not need to provide a password to authenticate, but the user will be in restricted shell mode. What is restricted shell? If Bash is started with the name rbash, or the –restricted or -r option is supplied at invocation, the shell becomes restricted. A restricted shell is used to set up an environment more controlled than the standard shell. A restricted shell behaves identically to bash with the exception that some commands are disallowed or not performed. For instances, changing directories with the cd builtin is prohibited in restricted shell. To cope with this, we can use a trick called SSH self loop-back, which means we initiate a SSH connection inside a SSH, since restricted shell doesn’t prevent us from using SSH commands. First, we connect to the SSH server using the username restricted. From the source, we also know that the exposed port is 1337. Then, we can use SSH self loop-back to have the permission to use cat, since we also know that flag.txt is changed to flag_* (with * represents some random bytes) and lies in plainsight.

By using IDA Pro or Ghidra or any other kinds of decompiler, we will get the decompiled code. Analyze the main function, we claim that the program initiates an array whose size is 45, then modifies it through some more functions, as shown below. int __cdecl main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp) { void *Block; // [esp+4h] [ebp-BCh] int v5[45]; // [esp+8h] [ebp-B8h] BYREF v5[0] = 10; v5[1] = -3; ... snip v5[43] = 14; v5[44] = 16; Block = (void *)sub_401AC0(v5, 38, 0); sub_4013B0(Block); sub_401B40(Block); return 0; } The function sub_401AC0(v5, 38, 0) allocates dynamic memory using malloc based on v5 then assigns it into variable Block.
